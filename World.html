        <h3>Venus found to be more geologically active than previously believed</h3>
        </p>In a summary of the research, which was released Monday and has been published in the PNAS (Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences), the international authors wrote that they had identified a pattern of tectonic deformation suggesting that many of the hellish planet's lowlands have fragmented into "discrete crustal blocks," which have moved relative to each other in the geologically recent past.</p>

        <p>"These motions may be the result of mantle convection and, if so, constitute a style of interior–surface coupling not seen elsewhere in the inner Solar System except for continental interiors on Earth," they said. "Venus’ fragmented, mobile lithosphere may offer a framework for understanding how tectonics on Earth operated in the Archean."</p>
        
        <p>Archean Eon is the earlier of two divisions of Precambrian time and the period when life first formed on Earth about 4 billion years ago.</p>
