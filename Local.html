        <h3>Rain and cooler temperatures bring relief for firefighters in Arizona</h3>
        </p>As fire crews work to put out wildfires across the state, firefighters said Wednesday's gloomy and rainy weather has an impact on what they're doing. Shawn Gilleland with Rural Metro Fire said lower temperatures and rain help cool down firefighters, while higher humidity can slow the fire. "It's preventative in some ways as it drops that moisture and rain. It's going to help hopefully prevent further fires or fires in different areas," said Gilleland.</p>

        <p>However, he said thunderstorms can stop air operations and be dangerous for crews. "With the different weather patterns and the wind shifting, it can change fire behavior," said Gilleland. "It can make it more hazardous for firefighters."</p>
        
        <p>Laura Rabon with the U.S. Forest Service is handling public relations for the Wyrick Fire. She said fires across the state seemed to be less intense Wednesday, and she credits that to the weather.</p>

        <p>Rural Metro Fire is working with the Governor's Office, finding out how it can help fight fires around the state. Gilleland said the weather plays a big role in how much assistance crews will need. "I think they're saying thank you for the lower temperatures and hopefully just praying there will be more rain coming," said Gilleland.</p>
